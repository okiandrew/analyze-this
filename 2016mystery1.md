# Corporate Strategies to Reduce Single Occupancy Vehicle Trips: Coca-Cola’s Case Study

*Eric Ganther, Workplace 2020 Transportation Manager, Coca-Cola*

## Problem

Coca-Cola is seeking to reduce single occupancy vehicle trips 20% by 2020 to meet climate, civic, and real estate goals. The company is reluctant to charge for parking at its offices in Atlanta for fear of angering employees. Robust alternative programs exist that support carpooling, transit, and bike riding. Teleworking is also encouraged. However, use of these programs without disincentives to driving may not be sufficient to achieve the 20% reduction.

## Assignment

This group will formulate a travel demand management plan that can meet Coca-Cola’s vehicle trip reduction goal but is sensitive to Coca-Cola’s relationship with their employees and their reluctance to charge for parking.
