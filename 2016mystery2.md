# Repurposing Travel Lanes for Multimodal Projects

*Andy Nash, Green City Streets with Natalie Stiffler, City of Boulder*

## Problem

A challenge when proposing to widen sidewalks, install a bike lane, or add a transit only lane is that space often needs to be taken from automobile lanes causing drivers and/or businesses to complain that taking road space will increase congestion.

For example, the City of Boulder recently implemented the Folsom Living Lab project. The project repurposed a one 1.6 mile section of Folsom St. to provide protected and/or buffered bike lanes along the corridor. The project was slated to be in place for one year; however, due to a high variability in travel times and public discontent due to increased traffic congestion, the project was scaled back at two critical intersections along the corridor. A variety of questions resulted from the project and consideration of other similar projects including the following:

* How do we evaluate the congestion impacts of repurposing roadway space for alternative uses? Are these methods analytically correct? Are there better analysis methods available?
* Can congestion impacts be outweighed by other benefits from the project, such as real or perceived? Are there better measures to focus on rather than congestion (e.g., environmental)? How does local policy impact this question?
* What types of transport analysis methods can the public best relate to? The City of Boulder found that with the Folsom Living Lab, LOS didn’t resonate with the public. People were more interested in the extra minute or two of travel time that they would experience in their peak hour commute. How best to communicate project goals and objectives, and potential tradeoffs?

## Assignment

Using the City of Boulder’s recent Folsom Street Living Lab project as a case study, this group will devise a plan to evaluate the potential congestion impacts of reallocating roadway space.
