# Incorporating Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (C/AV) Technologies into the City of Edmonton Regional Travel Demand Model

*Erin Toop, City of Edmonton*

## Problem

Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (C/AV) technology will potentially have drastic effects on our mobility systems, impacting all transportation users whether or not they adopt the technology. The City of Edmonton is currently reviewing C/AV updates to our planning framework and investigating regulatory issues, but we also need a means to integrate the potential travel demand implications of C/AV technology into our regional model. This remains a large problem to be solved not only for the City of Edmonton, but for regional travel demand modeling as a practice. As such, we pose the following problem for analysis: what will be the travel behavior impacts of C/AVs in cities like Edmonton and how do we adapt/extend our travel models to assess these impacts?

Initially, we want to explore how to integrate assumptions about C/AVs into our current regional tour-based transportation modelling framework. Specifically, how will the emergence of C/AVs affect:

* Auto-ownership (individual owners, carsharing or ridesourcing systems?)
* Mode choice (new mode?)
* Parking (lower parking prices?)
* Highway assignment (improvements by functional class?)
* Transit (Autonomous transit vehicles?)

Going forward, we want to explore the advantages of other model approaches, e.g. Activity-Based Modeling and Dynamic Traffic Assignment, as well as the potential for stated preference surveys to understand early adopters and analyze longitudinal travel behavior as the technology evolves.

## Assignment

This group will identify the likely behavior impacts of C/AVs in cities like Edmonton and develop a approach to account for C/AVs in their travel analysis methods.
