# Planning Mystery &#35;3
All Autonomous Vehicles Shall Come with Ejection Seats:  Let’s Imagine Some Policy Options That Make Sense in This New World
Presented by Dick Mudge, Compass Transportation and Technology

## Problem
Urban transportation is in the midst of a sea change generated by autonomous vehicles, shared mobility services, and changed market preferences for density and vehicle ownership.  

New vehicles have the promise of eliminating most crashes, reducing congestion, and encouraging new travel patterns. Shared mobility will help discourage auto ownership. New attitudes regarding vehicle ownership and urban living imply shifts in demand. The challenge is to make sense from this series of non-linear changes and develop the appropriate policy responses. The key questions in terms of:

* Modeling and Forecasting
  * What is the role of traditional models in the face of such uncertainty?
  * How can we generate reasonable forecasts when the past offers no guidance?
  * Are scenarios the key tool of future planning?
* Planning and Policy
  * Do long-range plans make any sense when we are faced with this pace and scale of change?  
  * Given that major transportation investments often take a decade or two to plan and build, what type of investments are appropriate?  
  * What trigger points might we use to identify changes in technology, the pace of deployment, and market responses?
  * How has our menu of policy responses changed and how might they vary based on different community values?

Failure to resolve these issue risks damage to the credibility of long-range plans and may result in public investment or policies that fail to guide new transportation developments.

## Assignment

This group will sketch out potential policy responses to these phenomena that will be useful over the next 5 years as well as suggestions for how to include these phenomena in planning and forecasting exercises.   What rules of thumb make sense?  What do we need to know in order to develop plans that are practical and credible?

# Summary Report
*prepared by Pat Coleman*

* Urban transportation is in the midst of a sea change generated by autonomous vehicles, shared mobility services, and changed market preferences for density and vehicle ownership.
* Groups sketched out potential policy responses to these phenomena that will be useful over the next 5 years as well as suggestions for how to include these phenomena in planning and forecasting exercises. What rules of thumb make sense? What do we need to know in order to develop plans that are practical and credible?
* Tables facilitated by Mara Campbell and Stephen Crim

## Findings

* Jason Mumford presented:
  * The wave is hitting; we are in the midst of it.
  * Group consensus is needed for desired outcomes
  * Safety equity/accessibility, etc.
  * Time savings important as is public perspective – better funding
  * Establish values for permanent metrics; getting data; iterative processes ; roles of government, etc.
* Mara Campbell presented:
  * More high level discussion – what will VMT impact be in five years; equity issues; platform (vehicle ownership models, etc.).  Optimism for accessibility to jobs, etc.
  * Investment for the next 5 years; changing the conversation; look at funding
  * What policies do we need?  Data sharing and access important – modeling; private sector will not wait
  * Start small with pilot projects to find out what we need to know
* Stephen Crim presented :
  * Make sure community impacts reflected
  * Curbside management/inventory important
  * Each locality needs a point person  to link engineering and policies.  
  * Look at AV’s arrival for new funding sources (VMT taxation).  
  * Use MPO’s scenario planning and “visioning documentation” to deal with uncertainty.  
* Brendon Hemily posed a question of equity of funding and what happens with pricing of empty vehicles.   
* Jason Mumford suggested gathering data on curb usage.

## Discussion Notes

“We don’t know what we don’t know but we know what we want”

What is the role of traditional models in the face of uncertainty:

* What’s coming? What change is coming, when will it arrive
* Easier to long term forecast in this case, but much harder for the next long years
* Activity based may be more

Affordability and equity

Are trip based good enough?

Vehicle ownership models

Sketch planning? Now strategic planning and scenario planning,

Barriers to activity based: big data- expensive, requires expertise, take a lot of time to develop, management, but they are necessary for the future autonomous models

What’s the impact on travel and land use (VMT, jobs, investment) in the next 5 years:

* Opportunity to set up the platform to plan for AVs
  * Privacy, work with technology firms
  * Need to set up policies to share data with public entities
* VMT has been going down, trend will continue
* VMT is tied to funding so very important
* Private is not going to wait for policy

What’s the impact on jobs?

* Shift in the job market
* Globalization- impacts, equity
* We need a way to monitor how trends are changing!
* Huge increase in access to jobs / overall accessibility
* Labor intensive industries will go to more automated, maybe not next five years
  * Planning is again key

Investment:

* Transit, not big impact in just five years, but there is room to invest

Policy responses:

* Changing the definition of infrastructure
* Data sharing policies are going to be critical

Suggestions for how to incorporate the policy possibilities with the modelling/forecasting

* Start with parking, small, pilot projects
* Focus on human travel behaviour
* Change the conversation from vehicle to human
* Staying engaged with private industry (market drivers)
* Shift to ABM

What do we need to know?

* Getting the data sharing protocols in place
* When is it happening?
* How we adjust measures and measures of performance for projects we are going to implement?
  * What do we need to be monitoring for this change/transition?
* What are the details that will matter in individual locations? Lane recognition during snow, weather affects performance
  * Hi Def mapping? So we don’t rely on lane recognition, etc
* What is the role of government, other players, industry?
  * Otherwise industry will just set up shop and define it for us
* Data sharing

Priorization: if you were starting tomorrow, what would you try to do

* Roles, data sharing, metrics

Desired outcomes, for whom?

1. Safety
2. Equity
3. Efficiency, reliable

Scenario planning, the POV of different levels of policy makers (next five years)

* Local
  * Community impacts
* State
* MPO
* Feds
* All levels
  * Getting data
  * Defining metrics
